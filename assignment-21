The steps Building a complete multi-user todo backend API with JWT token-based authentication in Laravel:
1. Setup Laravel Project:

>> Install Laravel using Composer.
>> Configure the database and necessary settings in the .env file.
2. Set up Database:

>> Create the database schema for storing users and todo items.
3. Implement User Authentication:

>> Set up user registration and login endpoints using Laravel's built-in authentication scaffolding or a package like Laravel Sanctum or Laravel Passport.
>> Generate JWT tokens upon successful authentication.
4. Define Todo API Endpoints:

>> Create routes for CRUD operations for todo items, such as /api/todos, /api/todos/{id}, etc.
>> Implement controllers for these routes to handle the corresponding actions.
5. Protect API Endpoints:

>> Use middleware to authenticate requests using JWT tokens.
>> Restrict access to todo items based on the authenticated user.
6. Implement CRUD Operations:

>> Create the necessary logic in the controller methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todo items for each user.
>> Ensure that users can only access their own todo items.
7. Error Handling:

>> Implement proper error handling and return meaningful error responses.
8. Test API Endpoints:

>> Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test the API endpoints.
9. Document the API:

>> Create clear and concise documentation for your API using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI or Laravel API documentation packages.
10. Deployment:

>> Deploy Laravel application to a server or hosting platform.
